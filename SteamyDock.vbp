The vb5 conversion from string to a number was just stupid and pointless. It did nothing useful.  decimal value needed to be expressed as a long integer, that's it, no conversion required.

The problem is the resulting offset is dynamically assumed to be a mouse movement, a deviation from left ' so it causes more animation that moves the selected icon to a couple of positions to the right - so commented out  '  at the moment all animation is controlled by a deviation from the leftmost icon position, I could make the anchor point the centre of the icon '  and use the deviation to the left or right of the centre line to grow the icons immediately to left/right but that would give me half the granularity '  the current method has, bear in mind the deviation is measured in pixels and the smallest large icon size might be 64.
