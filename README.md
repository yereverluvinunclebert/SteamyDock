# SteamyDock

A VB6 and TwinBasic GDI+ WoW64 dock for Reactos, XP, Win7, 8 and 10.

![cogs](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/SteamyDock/assets/2788342/ba617c24-0c77-4577-b211-47e1c05a4a5e)

SteamyDock is a functional reproduction of the dock we all know and
love - Rocketdock for Windows from Punklabs - which in turn was a
clone of the Mac OS/X dock. Back in the Noughties, there were other
docks too such as ObjectDock, all of them good, some commercial, some
free. Our new dock, SteamyDock is also free, each allow you to create
your own dock using your own personal style and any icons you choose
to import from any location.

SteamyDock gets its name from the bundling of my own three dock
utilities with my own self-created Steampunk icon sets, ie. SteamyDock
is a dock and the icons are steamy... so there you have it.

SteamyDock is Alpha-grade software, under development, not yet ready
to use on a production system - use at your own risk.

BUILD: The program runs without any Microsoft plugins.

Built using: VB6, MZ-TOOLS 3.0, VBAdvance, CodeHelp Core IDE Extender
Framework 2.2 & Rubberduck 2.4.1. 

In addition, changes have been made to make it compatible with TwinBasic, so it now compiles and runs using TwinBasic.

Tested on :

	ReactOS 0.4.14 32bit on virtualBox  
	Windows 7 Professional 32bit on Intel  
	Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit on Intel  
	Windows 7 Professional 64bit on Intel  
	Windows XP SP3 32bit on Intel  
	Windows 10 Home 64bit on Intel  
	Windows 10 Home 64bit on AMD  
	Windows 11 64bit on Intel

Dependencies:

o A windows-alike o/s such as Windows XP, 7-11 or ReactOS.

o Microsoft VB6 IDE installed with its runtime components. The program runs 
without any additional Microsoft OCX components, just the basic controls that 
ship with VB6.

o GDI+ 

o Requires a steamydock folder in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\
eg: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\steamydock
Requires a docksettings.ini file to exist in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\PzEasteamydockrth
The above will be created automatically by the compiled program when run for the
first time.

o OLEEXP.TLB placed in sysWoW64 - required to obtain the explorer paths only
during development. OLEEXP.TLB placed in sysWoW64 - required to obtain the
explorer paths.

oleexp.tlb should typically be located in SysWow64 (or System32 on a 32-bit
Windows install). You can register it manually using regtlib.exe on Win 7-10
systems or the newer utility on Win 11.

However, it should be sufficient to let VB6 register it for you. When you first
try to run or compile it will come up with the project references utility. Point
OLEEXP to the correct location (SysWoW64). You should only have one copy
installed. Only needed during development as the types are compiled in. Once
your project is compiled, the TLB is no longer used. It does not need to be
present on end user machines.

![syswow64](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a33027-0c6c-4db1-8d70-f32f40b4d077)

From the command line, copy the tlb to a central location (system32 in a 32bit system or wow64
folder in a 64bit system) and register it.

	' COPY TO CORRECT LOCATION
 
	COPY OLEEXP.TLB %SystemRoot%\System32\
	COPY OLEEXP.TLB %SystemRoot%\SYSWOW64\

	' REGISTER THE TLB
 
	REGTLIB %SystemRoot%\System32\OLEEXP.TLB ' 32bit
	REGTLIBV12.EXE %SystemRoot%\SYSWOW64\OLEEXP.TLB  ' 64 bit
	"Registration of C:\WINDOWS\SYSWOW64\OLEEXP.TLB successful"

In the VB6 IDE select the menu - project - references, then browse and select the OLEEXP.tlb. You might have to restart the IDE to make 
use of the TLB references.

Other Dependencies:

o Steamydock's configuration is achieved using two other VB6 utilities. Icon-Settings-for-Steamydock 
and DockSettings-for-Steamydock. Requires the SteamyDock program source code to be downloaded and available in 
an adjacent folder as some of the BAS modules are common and shared.

Example folder structure:
	
	E:\VB6\steamydock   ! this repo.
	E:\VB6\docksettings ! from [https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/dockSettings](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/DockSettings-for-Steamydock)
	E:\VB6\rocketdock   ! from [https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/rocketdock](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Icon-Settings-for-Steamydock)

VB6 does not allow the native creation of DLLs without some chicanery, so this project has no
shared library DLLs, instead it shares code via .BAS modules with the other utils listed above.

Credits:

I have really tried to maintain the credits as the project has progressed. If I
have made a mistake and left someone out then do forgive me. I will make amends
if anyone points out my mistake in leaving someone out.

MicroSoft in the 90s - MS built good, lean and useful tools in the late 90s and
early 2000s. Thanks for VB6.

Peacemaker2000 Original idea for a GDI+ dock came from here:
http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=55352&lngWId=1&fbclid=IwAR2FeR12CdaxyOoY-muw-b6_oDW-_19oLrt8syEL6BQSX4PMEfHyWpfqpzM

Olaf Schmidt - used some of Olafs code as examples of how to implement the
handling of images using GDI+ and specifically used two routines,
createScaledImg & ReadBytesFromFile.

Also critically, the idea of using the scripting dictionary as a repository
for a collection of image bitmaps.

In addition, the easeing functions to do the bounce animation, I initially
used a converted .js implementation but Olafs was better.

Background:

I always loved Rocketdock for its ease of use, the fact that it was
free to download but more importantly because it allowed each of your
PCs to display a desktop with a look and feel that was unique to you.
At the time Objectdock and Rocketdock were developed. customisation
was the name of the game, everyone was doing it and Rocketdock made
it easy and painless to do so. Then came the change in the form of
Windows 8 and 10... and a drastic rework to Microsoft's corporate
policies meant that customisation was frowned upon, companies such as
MS and Apple now wanted all your systems to look and operate just like
everyone else's, corresponding to a corporate style. Each recent
change to the Windows operating system has made it more closed and
more difficult to customise. Slowly but surely, due to these changes
being accepted by users, Rocketdock and other customisation tools
fell out of favour and as a result Rocketdock's developers Punklabs
moved onto better things and Rocketdock is no longer supported by
them, meaning no more updates to fix bugs and no new versions with
improved functionality. This is a problem for me as I want to use it
on the latest versions of Windows.

Increasingly, Microsoft has changed Windows in unexpected and
unpleasant ways introducing little problems for Rocketdock and its
remaining users. Despite this, perhaps surprisingly, Rocketdock still
works today even on Windows 10, however, it is becoming increasingly
difficult to configure and operate with reliability. Without support
and in the absence of new versions, users can struggle to make the old
program run in the easy manner that they were accustomed to under
Windows XP. With that in mind I stepped into the breach (as
Rocketdock's self-styled saviour) and I have created an open source
version of something akin to RocketDock in both spirit and in design,
this time named SteamyDock. Please note - SteamyDock hasn't used any
of Rocketdock's code nor any of its resources, it has all been built
from scratch.

I have been communicating with Skunkie from Punklabs and she has given
me approval and encouragement to recreate Rocketdock in functionality
and form, so that is what I have been doing. Instead of recreating
Rocketdock as one monolithic tool I have instead decided to recreate
it in three separate components, biting off what I can chew, as it
were. First of all I have created the Icon Settings Tool, adding a lot
more functionality than Rocketdock's original icon settings
configuration tool. Secondly, I created the utility that replicates
Rocketdock's Dock Settings configuration tool. Note that no code, nor
resource has been taken from Punklabs nor Rocketdock, all the code,
resources and icons shown are my own creation. All I have replicated
is the functionality of Rocketdock and even then I have hopefully
improved upon it and also upon the visual form.

SteamyDock is compatible with Rocketdock in many ways. It can use the
same icons, the dock and icon configuration screens are very similar
in operation so will be quite familiar to Rocketdock users. The main
advantage of Steamydock over Rocketdock is that this new version is
supported. In addition, it also has some new functionality and
improvements. Fundamentally though, the design is limited to providing
or enhancing what Rocketdock already provides. This will make the dock
and its supporting utilities quite familiar to Rocketdock users.
This program will be available in two flavours. The first is a VB6
version, this is the original. The second will be a VB.NET version,
not yet available. The two will be functionally the same, in almost
all respects. The choice of which version to use will be entirely up
to you. The VB.NET version has yet to be completed but when done will
future-proof this utility. Regardless, the VB6 version should work on
Windows 10 for the 'foreseeable future' which means years and years
yet to come as of 2021. Note that the VB6 version will also operate on
ReactOS, a 32bit-only Windows clone when its WINE-inspired GDI+ layer
is implemented

32bitness, I hear you say? - The VB6 version is of course 32 bit by
default as that is all a VB6 application can ever be. VB6 is a 32bit
language. Some see running 32bits as a limitation. It is not really,
because of course, 32-bit applications run just fine on all versions
of 64-bit Windows and this dock does not need 64bits to operate. This
program has no need to use the main advantage of 64bit functionality -
that being the ability to access more than 4gb of RAM. This utility
does not require anywhere near the 4gigabytes maximum of RAM that
32bit applications can address. In fact it averages just 45mb of usage
even with seventy-two 128x128 bit icons displayed.

If you really do care about the 64bit thing and won't run 32bit
programs on a 64bit system for some personal reason, then wait until
the TwinBasic version comes out.
