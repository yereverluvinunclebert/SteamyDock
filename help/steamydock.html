<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>















</big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig 01. Showing Steamydock in operation on Windows 10.</span><br>















<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>















Welcome to SteamyDock.</big><br>

















<br>

















SteamyDock is a functional reproduction of the dock we all know and
love - Rocketdock&nbsp;for Windows from Punklabs - which in turn
was a
clone of the Mac
OS/X dock. Back in the Noughties, there
were other docks too such as ObjectDock, all of them good, some
commercial,
some free. Our new dock, SteamyDock is also free, each allow you to
create your own dock using
your own personal style and
any icons you choose to import from any location.&nbsp;<br>

















<br>

















SteamyDock gets its name from the bundling of my own three dock
utilities
with my own self-created Steampunk icon sets, ie.
SteamyDock&nbsp;is a dock and the
icons are steamy... so there you have it. <br>

















<br>

















<img title="Some of SteamyDock's bundled icons." style="width: 1040px; height: 424px;" alt="Some of SteamyDock's bundled icons." src="windowsGeneralIcons.png"><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">











Fig 02. Some of SteamyDock's bundled icons.</span><br>















<br>

















Now, you don't have to use my icons, you can make your dock as 'modern'
or as uniquely different as you like. The steampunk icon sets are just
there to complete the package and give you something to install with
the new dock. So, your dock doesn't have to be steamy at all. Simply
place your modern icons in a location where Steamydock can find them and it
will use them.<br>

















<br>









SteamyDock is Alpha-grade software, under development, not yet ready to
use on a production system - use at your own risk.
Things SteamyDock can't yet do... or has problems with:<br>

















<ul>

















  <li>Animations are generally not as good as those in RocketDock<br>








  </li>

















  <li>Animations are missing on&nbsp;icon
deletion,&nbsp;I aim to implement this in the future.</li>








  <li>Animations are missing on dock closure,&nbsp;I aim to implement this in the future.</li>

















  <li>Similar animations to Rocketdock's are missing on drag and drop into the 
  dock,&nbsp;I aim to implement this in the future, at the moment you will see a 
  rotating hourglass when you hover a dragged icon over the dock.</li>

















  <li>SteamyDock is incompatible with Rocketdock's themed backgrounds but
instead has its own themeing implementation.</li>

















  <li>Cannot use docklets. Docklets derive from an undocumented
Objectdock standard and are now obsolete and so Steamydock is unlikely
to ever support them.</li>

















  <li>The dock itself cannot yet extract embedded&nbsp;icons
from EXEs and display them
with a transparent background - this is tricky as VB6 has no native PNG
support.&nbsp;I aim to implement this in the future when I know how...</li>

















  <li>Right/left dock positions will not be supported unless someone shouts loud.</li>

















  <li>Only one dock animation type currently implemented.</li>

















  <li>Does not support multiple languages in the translation of
menu options.&nbsp;</li>

















</ul>

















SteamyDock improves on Rocketdock in various ways:<br>





























<ul>

















  <li>For compatibility, the dock can read
Rocketdock's obsolete registry/settings locations but now stores its
data in the future-proof location of AppData.</li>








  <li>It can also save its data to the&nbsp;registry or the settings.ini.</li>

















  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It
animates and displays the dock efficiently using less cpu than
Rocketdock.</li>

















  <li>It is open source which means that anyone can build it even you.</li>








  <li>It contains no third-party libraries nor any code that is not freely FOSS.</li>

















  <li>It is&nbsp;written using a friendly language accessible
to beginners and experts alike - VB6!.</li>

















  <li>The associated utilities offer more options for
configuration.</li>

















  <li>This version is currently supported - by me, you and anyone who cares to make changes or improvements.</li>








  <li>It will soon have a VB.NET/TwinBasic/RadBasic counterpart for 64bit future-proofing.</li>








  <li>It has been tested and runs on Windows XP, Win7 to 10  32bit (and 64 bit in .NET form) and also on 32bit ReactOS.</li>

















  <li>It works on the latest version of Windows without
compromise in functionality.</li>

















  <li>Steamydock allows for&nbsp;increased icon maximum sizes of up to
256x256 pixels, previously Rocketdock was limited to 128,</li>

















  <li>Steamydock&nbsp;is fully documented.</li>

















  <li>Runs applications as administrator if required.</li>

















  <li>Adding icons via the right click menu offers many more icon
options.</li>

















  <li>Additional menu option for deleting any running application
instance.</li>

















  <li>Additional hiding options, a new fade, instant and
continuous hide.</li>

















  <li>Can run new instances of an application at will</li>

















  <li>Can&nbsp;maximise and minimise windows, even to/from
the systray.</li>

















  <li>Can alter the z-order of Windows, sending them to front and
back.</li>








  <li>There are&nbsp;tooltips for all controls in the two utilities.</li>








  <li>There is now a readily available help facility, you are reading it...</li>








  <li>The dock itself is&nbsp;fully functional while the configuration utility is
operating, Rocketdock caused the dock to be inoperative whilst it was running.</li>








  <li>The config utilities can configure both RocketDock and SteamyDock.</li>








</ul>

















<ul>

















</ul>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: SteamyDock is
Alpha-grade software, under development, use at your own risk.</span><br>

















<br>

















Regardless of what SteamyDock can or cannot do, SteamyDock is FOSS, ie,
free and open source. This means you can download and modify this dock
yourself. As long as there are VB6 programmers willing to fix or
change the code then unlike Rocketdock, this dock never needs to be made
obsolete. If there is
something broken or missing then you can fix it yourself. So far, I've
managed to make
a functioning dock and associated programs but be aware it is not yet
fully complete and not tested in all scenarios.
If it worries you to run unfinished software on your desktop computer
then remove it now <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please</span>
but perhaps come back another day when it is finally finished.<br>

<h3>Dock Operation<br>












</h3>












When the dock is run for the first time, the dock will display a series
of default icons that relate to typical applications that exist on your
system. The dock will appear at the top of the screen.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>








<h3>Basic Functionality</h3>











<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>When you move your cursor to the dock it will animate three icons,
causing each to grow. The name assigned to the icon will appear above
the central icon. If you click on any icon then it will run the
application associated&nbsp;with it. You can also right click on the
dock to access other options. If you press F11 the dock will disappear,
press it again and it will re-appear. That is the basic functionality
of the dock explained.<br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3>Icons</h3>

















When you place your icon over the dock, it will animate the highlighted
icon and the icons next to it. There will eventually be four types of
animation
but at the moment there is&nbsp;only one named "bump". A click on
the
largest icon will run the program or utility associated with the
icon. An animation effect will occur to show the icon has been
activated.<br>

















<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">









Fig 04a. The dock animation in operation</span><br>

















<br>

















Adding an application to the dock is achieved in two manners, first, by
dragging and dropping
its icon to the dock, secondly by right clicking and selecting "add an
icon". <br>

















<br>

</span><span class=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Running Application Indicators as shown in SteamyDock appearing above any icons with running applications.</span><br>














</span><br class="">















<span class=""></span>If the application associated with the icon is already 
	running then it will have a cog sitting above it. If you click on that icon 
	then it will not open a new instance of the program but instead 
	will&nbsp;minimise or maximise the running window as required. In this respect, 
	it operates in a similar fashion to the windows taskbar. &nbsp;The cog will 
	appear above running binaries and Explorer Windows. There may be a very 
	short delay for the cog to appear above recently initiated Explorer windows.<br>




<br>

Fig 04c.&nbsp;The Red X </span><span class=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invalid Application Indicators as shown in SteamyDock appearing above any icons with missing or invalid applications.<br>





<br>





</span></span>If the application associated with the icon is found to be missing or is invalid then it
will have a red 'x' sitting above it. If you click on that icon then it
will not open a new instance of the intended program as it cannot be found, instead
it will pop up a&nbsp;message box alerting you to the fault.<br>
	<span class="" style="font-weight: bold;">




	<br><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">Drag and drop TO the dock <br>








</span>
</span><br><span class="">












Drag and drop is enabled by default, you can enable or disable it at any time by 
	a right click on the dock to select the option to enable.</span><span class="" style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
</span>
<span class="">




	When you drag an application icon to the dock you will see a rotating 
	hourglass when you hover your cursor over the dock. This tells you where the 
	new application icon will be placed. As you move the cursor along the dock 
	the hourglass will move with your cursor. When you drop the icon from the 
	Windows desktop onto the dock then Steamydock will extract an icon from the 
	binary and create a PNG in order to place it within the dock at your chosen 
	location. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
<img alt="hourglass" title="adminMode.png" src="hourglass.jpg"><br>
<span class="" style="font-weight: bold;">




Fig 04d.&nbsp;The Rotating Hourglass indicating drag in operation.</span></span><br>
	<br>In the Dock Settings Behaviour Tab there is an option <strong>&quot;Icon 
	Origin&quot;</strong>, unclick this and SteamyDock will attempt to identify it and incorporate the new icon
into the dock, choosing a suitable icon from
the icon collections available. Having done this it will then pop up the Icon 
	Settings tool so that you can see the properties of the new icon (this can 
	be disabled in Dock Settings).<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: If &nbsp;Steamydock is
running as admin then drag and drop to the dock will not function. This
is Microsoft's way of ensuring encapsulation of processes with
privileges, so you cannot pass a message to a program with admin rights
in order to make it do something naughty. If you ever find yourself
unable to drag and drop to the dock just close the dock and restart it
without administrator rights (right click - properties - advanced -
administrative rights OFF. Also, the same in the compatibility settings.</span><br>
	<br>The sovereign image is
just a reminder to you that the dock has admin rights. The dock is best run <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without</span>
	admin rights.<br>








	<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>

</span>
<br>
	<br>












<br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">Drag FROM the dock <br>








<br>








</span>If you drag an icon from the dock then that will be interpreted
as an
icon deletion to match Rocketdock functionality. In this case though, a
message will always pop up asking you to confirm whether the
icon deletion is intentional.<br>












<br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">Drag and drop WITHIN the dock <br>








<br>








</span>If you click and drag an icon from one position of the dock to
another then the
dock will interpret that as an icon move, depositing the icon to the
new location.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;<br>








<br>













<h3>Menus &amp; Other Options</h3>

















<p><img style="width: 631px; height: 362px;" alt="SteamyDock showing right click menu options." title="SteamyDock showing right click menu options." src="instance.png"><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">











Fig 05. SteamyDock showing right click menu options.</span></p>

















<p>A right-click on any icon in the icon pane will give you more
options,&nbsp;the main menu is disclosed when right-clicking
anywhere on the dock.&nbsp;The menu options displayed will differ
according to whether the application associated with this icon is
already running. If it is running then the following additional options
will be displayed.<br>

















</p>

















<p><img style="width: 255px; height: 384px;" alt="SteamyDock right click menu options when an application is already running." title="SteamyDock right click menu options when an application is already running." src="menu.png"><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 06. SteamyDock right click menu options when an application is already running.</span></p>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Run New Instance of this
App</span>
<p>If the application is already running then you now have the
choice
of initiating another instance of the app, ie. you can run it again in
a new window. Some applications specifically forbid this or have an
option to allow it. Running an application this way will not override
an application specific setting.</p>

















<p style="font-weight: bold;">Close Running Instance of
this App</p>

















<p>If the application is already running then it will have a cog
sitting above it. If so, you then have the choice of killing the
application
from the dock, this is very useful if the application has hung or is
unresponsive. Note that
it will kill all instances of the program you have chosen to kill.
Eg.&nbsp;if you have three instances of the program running it will end
all three. If you are closing an application such as Firefox or Chrome
please note that it will have multiple processes to kill and you will
be prompted to kill each one.&nbsp;</p>


<p>If you use Steamydock to kill an unresponsive full screen game that
has had a fatal graphics error then do be aware that the pop-up msgbox
confirming closure might be underneath the unresponsive window. For
tasks such as this it might be better to fire up taskmgr. </p>

















<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bring Application to Front</p>

















<p>If the application is already running then you have the choice
of
bringing the window to the front, ie. placing it on top of all other
windows.</p>

















<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Send Application
to Back</span></p>

















<p>If the application is already running then you have the choice
of
sending the window to the back, ie. placing it underneath all other
windows. This will place the chosen window right to the very back, ie.
even underneath&nbsp;background Windows such as widget engines that
traditionally sit right underneath all other windows. The
effect&nbsp;may surprise you at first but a click on the app itself
is enough to bring it forward again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The above four options are not available for Explorer windows. </p>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<img title="SteamyDock right click menu options for an icon when no associated application is running." style="width: 256px; height: 330px;" alt="menu for non SteamyDock right click menu options for an icon when no associated application is running." src="menuNonRunning.png"><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 07. SteamyDock right click menu options for an icon when no associated application is running.</span><br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

















Run this App</span><br>

















<br>












If the dock icon does not display a cog above it, then it is not
running or has not been initiated by the dock. When this is the case,
only two&nbsp;options will be offered, the first being to 'run the app'. This option is
the same as a click on the icon itself but without any animation. On a
system that is running slowly due to a lot of active applications this
may be the quicker option.<br>




<br>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">












Run this App As Administrator</span><br>

















<br>




The second option will be offered to 'run the app as administrator'.
This option allows you to temporarily run this application with
elevated privileges. Some apps require elevated access in order to
operate. For example, the VB6 or other similar IDEs will require
elevated access in order to recompile binaries that need to be directly
placed into the program files folders, for&nbsp;operation there.
Without elevated privileges the compilation will fail because it does
not have the admin access it requires to write directly to the program
files folder. There are similar scenarios where admin access is
required. When you want admin access as a one-off, use this option.<br>




<br>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">












Run New Instance of this App As Administrator<br>




<br>




</span>If the application is already running then you now have the
choice
of initiating another instance of the app, ie. you can run it again in
a new window, this time with elevated privileges.<br>




<br>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">












Run Elevated</span><br>

















<br>



This option&nbsp;is just for information and is really just the
equivalent of the "Run this App" option but is shown only when the icon
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">has already been designated</span>
to run in an elevated fashion. This is configured in the icon settings
utility. See below. Any icon can have the "Run Elevated" switch set so that the
specific app. always runs elevated.<br>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">












<br>



Note: </span>Some Apps do not like being run elevated, some apps will
not allow themselves to be run elevated (eg. Visual Studio Code) , and
Windows itself does not even like the attempt to run certain apps with
elevated privileges. Try to avoid using this facility unless absolutely
necessary. Windows will not allow explorer windows to run elevated so
the elevated option will not appear for these.<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

















Edit Icon Properties<br>
















<br>

















</span>
When using the dock, if
you hover over an icon and select the right-click menu, you will see
"Edit Icon Properties". Choosing that&nbsp;will open the icon
settings
utility and display the current icon and its properties
<p>The Icon settings screen is a separate program which you use
to configure the individual
icons, which application they represent and the text that will be
displayed above
each icon in the dock. The&nbsp;Icon settings screen
is&nbsp;modelled on that
provided by Rocketdock with some detail changes and enhancements.&nbsp;</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 08. SteamyDock Icon Settings Utility.</span><br>














<br>

















This utility has its own help so we won't go into it in detail here.
Suffice to say that you can select icon sets, add or delete items in
the dock and modify the dock icons and their target applications. To
view the help for this tool, when it is open, select the tool's help
page using the right click menu in the same manner as when you selected
this help
page from the dock.<br>

















<br>

















Note: You can also
add icons to the dock&nbsp;by using this utility&nbsp;and
modifying the
icon map (see the help for the icon settings tool).<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Deleting An Icon</p>

















<p>This option is only enabled when the dock is unlocked,
otherwise it is greyed out. This prevents
accidental deletion of icons from the dock. You can delete an icon at
any time but use it sparingly as it is not quite as easy to get your
icon back again.</p>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding an icon.</span><br>

















<br>

















When you select this option it will present you with a list of target
types that can be added to your icon position. Choose the one that
seems most appropriate to your requirement.&nbsp;<br>

When you disable the particular icon, it will no longer respond to a
click. It will pop up a message box and inform you that the icon is
disabled. Any disabled icon will appear in reduced opacity. If an icon is disabled already then this option will state "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-enable this Icon</span>".<br style="font-weight: bold;">

















<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open App Folder in Windows Explorer.</span><br>

















<br>

















When you select this option, a file explorer window will open using the
folder location where your application is situated. A useful function to find an application quickly.<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>

















<h3>The Dock Settings Utility</h3>

















The dock settings screen is what we use to configure the whole dock.
The dock settings screen is closely modelled on that provided by
Rocketdock.<br>

















<br>

















<img style="width: 554px; height: 646px;" alt="dock settings" title="dock settings" src="dockS-stylePane.png"><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 10. The Dock Settings Utility</span><br>

















<br>

















This utility has its own help so we won't go into it in detail here.
Suffice to say that you can change the size of the icons, tell
the&nbsp;dock to auto-hide amongst other configuration
possibilities.
To
view the help for this tool, when it is open, select the tool's help
page using the right click menu in the same way&nbsp;when you
selected this help
page from the dock.<br>

















<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen Position.</span><br>

















<br>

















The dock can&nbsp;display in just two locations, top and bottom.
Rocketdock used to also display on the left and the right of the screen
but I found that functionality rather useless so I have not included it
in this version of SteamyDock. If you are desperate for it then please
let me know and I'll think about adding it. See the larger section on Dock Position *2<br>
<br>By default, the Windows taskbar is placed at the bottom. When Steamydock runs it 
will overlay the taskbar at the bottom. If the
<span class="auto-style2">Move Taskbar</span> option is enabled i<strong>n Dock 
Settings,&nbsp; </strong>in Windows 8-11 and above, it will move the windows taskbar to the opposite position, ie. 
bottom to top. In Windows XP-7 nothing will occur and you'll have to move the 
taskbar yourself. Steamydock will run just fine at the top of the screen but it is 
really designed to operate at the bottom of the screen.<br>

<br>

Please note that when you run a full screen game, the screen can change
to different resolutions,&nbsp;this can move SteamyDock off screen.
When you exit the game and find that SteamyDock is not visible, wait 5
seconds or so, SteamyDock should place itself back at the correct
location. <br>

















<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto-Hide option</span><br>

















<br>

















The dock can be made to auto-hide so that it does not interfere with
the running of other programs that&nbsp;require all your screen
space.
Autohide is achieved with either an instant disappear, sliding or
fading
animations, you choose.<br>

















<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hide for the next 10
minutes (F11) to restore<br>

















<br>

















</span>The dock can be made to&nbsp;hide for a certain time
by hand by
pressing a hot key toggle (F11 and a hide duration of 10 mins are the defaults) so that
the dock will not interfere with
the operation of other programs that are required to run full screen.
There is
no animation during a manual hide, the dock just hides. The key is
user-defined (in the dock settings) and the
dock can be immediately brought back by a further depression of the
same F11 key. The default time to hide can also be modified in the
settings.<br>

















<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable Drag and Drop and
Icon Deletion</span><br>

















<br>

















In Rocketdock parlance this used to be "Lock the dock". This option
simply disables the delete option in the menu and it also prevents
the user from dragging an item out of the dock, deleting it
automatically. Experience with Rocketdock tells me that it is best to
leave this item permanently checked. Steamydock has the same
ability to drag an icon from the dock but it is always followed by a confirmation dialog pop up.<br>














<br>

















<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other <br>








</span><img style="width: 233px; height: 177px;" alt="menu" src="menu03.jpg"><br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">






Fig 11. Other menu options</span><br>

















<br>

















The "other" option &nbsp;gives access to extra menu options, the
about screen, the help (this page) and other useful functions.<br>

















<br>








<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen Position&nbsp;*2<br />
<br />








</span></big>Please note: Steamydock is best placed at the bottom of your
screen. However,
in this case, the Windows taskbar is best moved to the top of the
screen where the two utilities will not interfere with each other. <br><br>From 
XP, Windows 7-10 that is a straightforward task, explained in the diagrams shown 
below. However,Windows 11 no longer has that feature (!) so instead, if you 
navigate to the <strong>Dock Settings - Position Tab</strong> you have the
<span class="auto-style2">Move Taskbar</span> option<span class="auto-style2">.</span> If this option is enabled 
when the user 
clicks <strong>Save</strong>, it will enable the automatic move of the windows taskbar to the opposite position, ie. 
bottom to top. <br><br>Whilst this occurs, please also note that the explorer 
backgroud and icons will flicker a little as explorer and its windows are 
restarted. Hoping that Microsoft will see sense and restore the ability to set 
this feature manually soon. For the moment though, we have a workaround but it 
does require the restart of Explorer.<br><br>Steamydock will run just fine at the top of the screen but it is 
designed to operate at the bottom of the<span class="auto-style2"> </span>screen 
as a taskbar replacement.<br><br>








<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">









Fig 03b. Position the Taskbar from the bottom to the top of the screen.<br>








<br>








</span>A right click on the taskbar brings up the context menu from which you should select the Properties option as shown above.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>








<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">









Fig 03c. Position the Taskbar from the bottom to the top of the screen.<br>








<br>








</span>Where
it states "Taskbar location on screen", there is a drop down to select
multiple positions. Select Top and the taskbar will move to
the top immediately. Alternatively, it is possible to drag and drop the
Windows Taskbar using the mouse to another location, as long as the
taskbar is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not locked</span> as shown above.<br>








<br>








<br><br><br>








<br>








<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Migration from RocketDock to SteamyDock </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">*1 </span></big><br>









<br>








Most users can ignore this section - This section is only for users of&nbsp; that want to
migrate their Rocketdock to SteamyDock. <br>








When that time comes&nbsp;all you
need to do is:<br>














<ul>








  <li>Right Click and select "Dock Settings"</li>








  <li>When the dock settings utility appears, select the General Pane.</li>








  <li>Where there is a drop down box stating, "Default dock" - select Rocketdock as the default dock.</li>








  <li>Select the location where the icon details are currently stored, that will be either the registry or the settings.ini
file according to how you have configured Rocketdock. Select that as the location to 'read' from.</li>








  <li>In the section below you will then set the 'write' location
to be
SteamyDock's own configuration area</li>








  <li>Click 'save and restart'.
RocketDock will restart.&nbsp;</li>








  <li>The final step is to set the 'read' location back to SteamyDock's
own configuration area&nbsp;</li>








  <li>Where there is a drop down box stating, "Default dock" - set the default dock to be SteamyDock.&nbsp;</li>








  <li>Press "save &amp; restart" again. Steamydock should then
restart, displaying all the old icons from their original Rocketdock locations.&nbsp;<br>








  </li>








</ul>








SteamyDock
will now be using its own user data area and any changes to SteamyDock will no longer
affect Rocketdock. If you choose to delete Rocketdock from your system, ensure that
you retain any icons that you want to continue to use in SteamyDock, ie. do not delete or move them.<br>

<h3>Technology:&nbsp;<br>

















</h3>

















The utility was created using VB6 and GDI+,
VB6 was Microsoft's once vaunted flagship
language. It was built upon Windows 7, Microsoft's last good desktop
operating system, I used VB6 to prove it can be done and to reacquaint
myself
with the technology. The utility will be migrated to TwinBasic
so there will be a version that is future-proof <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and 64bit</span>. This help
file
applies to either version as they will be functionally identical.<br>

















<h3>VB6 Version Credits:<br>

















</h3>

















<div style="text-align: justify;">The utility was created
using VB6,
Microsoft's once vaunted flagship
language. Microsoft created a superb tool but abandoned it much too
early in my opinion. I also used&nbsp;MZ-TOOLS 3.0, CodeHelp Core IDE Extender
Framework
2.2 &amp; Rubberduck 2.4.1. <br>

















<br>

















I used VB6 to prove to others that it "can be done" and to reacquaint myself
with the older technology. One of the utilities has already been migrated in parallel to
VB.NET but that version is incomplete as I simply prefer to code in VB6. This
help file
will apply to either the VB6 or the .NET version as they are functionally identical. This
program was built with the assistance of various snippets or chunks of
FOSS code. VB6 has been around for so long that&nbsp;the codebase
is
immense. You can find snippets to do this or that and I have utilised a
few bits of code for this dock which has sped the development
process immeasurably.<br>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span></big><br>









<br>









I always loved
Rocketdock
for its ease of use, the fact that it was free to download but more
importantly because it allowed each of your PCs to display a desktop
with a look and feel that was unique to you. At the time Objectdock and
Rocketdock were developed.
customisation was the name of the game, everyone
was doing it and Rocketdock made it easy and painless to do so. Then
came
the change in the form of Windows 8 and 10... and a drastic rework to
Microsoft's corporate
policies meant that customisation was frowned upon,
companies such as MS and Apple now wanted all your systems to look and
operate
just like everyone else's, corresponding to a corporate style. Each
recent change
to the Windows operating system
has made it&nbsp;more closed and more difficult to customise.
Slowly
but
surely,
due to these changes being accepted by users, Rocketdock and other
customisation tools fell out of favour and as a result Rocketdock's
developers&nbsp;Punklabs moved onto better things and&nbsp;Rocketdock is no longer supported by
them, meaning no more updates to fix bugs&nbsp;and no new versions
with
improved functionality. This is a problem for me as I want to use it on
the latest versions of Windows. <br>









<br>









Increasingly, Microsoft has changed
Windows in unexpected and unpleasant ways introducing little problems
for&nbsp;Rocketdock and its remaining users. Despite this,&nbsp;perhaps surprisingly, Rocketdock still works
today
even
on Windows 10, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
configure
and operate with&nbsp;reliability. Without support and in the
absence
of new
versions, users can struggle to make the old program run in the easy
manner that they were accustomed to under Windows XP. With that in mind
I stepped into the breach (as Rocketdock's self-styled saviour) and I
have created an open
source version of&nbsp;something akin to RocketDock in both spirit
and
in
design, this time named SteamyDock. Please note - SteamyDock hasn't
used any of
Rocketdock's code nor any of its resources, it has all been built from
scratch.<br>








<br>








I have been communicating with
Skunkie from Punklabs and she has given me approval and encouragement
to recreate&nbsp;Rocketdock in functionality and form, so that is what I
have been doing. Instead of recreating&nbsp;Rocketdock as one monolithic
tool I have instead decided to recreate it in three separate
components,
biting off what I can chew, as it were. First of all I have created the
Icon Settings Tool, adding a lot more functionality than&nbsp;Rocketdock's
original icon settings configuration tool. Secondly, I created the
utility that replicates&nbsp;Rocketdock's Dock Settings configuration tool. Note
that no code, nor resource has been taken from Punklabs nor&nbsp;Rocketdock,
all the code, resources and icons shown are my own creation. All I
have replicated is the functionality of&nbsp;Rocketdock and even then I have
hopefully improved upon it and also upon the visual form.<br>
















<br>

















SteamyDock is compatible with Rocketdock in many ways. It can use the
same icons, the dock and icon configuration screens are very
similar in operation so will be quite familiar to
Rocketdock
users. The main advantage of Steamydock over Rocketdock is that this
new version is&nbsp;supported. In addition, it also has some new
functionality and improvements. Fundamentally though, the design is
limited to providing or enhancing what
Rocketdock
already provides. This will make the dock and its supporting utilities
quite
familiar to Rocketdock
users.
<p>This program will be available in two flavours. The first is a
VB6
version, this is the original. The second will be a VB.NET version, not
yet available. The two will be functionally the same, in almost all
respects. The choice
of which version to use will be entirely up to you.
The VB.NET version has yet to be completed but when done will
future-proof this utility. Regardless, the VB6
version should work on Windows 10 for the 'foreseeable future' which
means years and years yet to come as of 2021. Note
that the&nbsp;VB6 version will also operate on ReactOS, a
32bit-only Windows clone when its WINE-inspired GDI+ layer is
implemented</p>

















<p>32bitness, I hear you say? &nbsp;- The VB6 version is of
course 32 bit by default as
that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span>
a VB6
application can ever be. VB6 is a 32bit language. Some see running
32bits as a limitation. It is
not really, because
of course, 32-bit applications run just fine on all versions of 64-bit
Windows and this dock does not need 64bits to operate. This program has
no need to use the main advantage of 64bit
functionality - that being the ability&nbsp;to access more than 4gb
of RAM. This utility
does not
require anywhere near the 4gigabytes maximum of RAM that 32bit
applications
can
address. In
fact it averages just 45mb of usage
even with seventy-two 128x128 bit icons displayed.&nbsp;</p>

















<p>If you really do care about the 64bit thing and won't run
32bit programs on a 64bit system for some personal reason,
then run the .NET version when it comes out. Personally I prefer the
32bit VB6 version, I know
them both inside out and VB6 is just 'better', easier to code and
certainly much more
fun to create.</p>

<h3>Donations:</h3>

















People like me create these tools and we do it for&nbsp;nothing,
for
free, gratis. However, it makes my day when someone sends a gift, a
treat or a present and it inspires me to do more. In all the time that
I have created all these tools (thirty or more tools) I have received
no more than a dozen or so
gifts but when someone has done so I feel like I have just
inherited&nbsp;a new friend. All I ask is that if you use this tool
and
continue to do so, consider sending me something small once every few
years. I have a penchant for licorice and cheap SSDs, the former is
cheap and brings a smile to my face, the latter has me running round
the room in circles.<br>
